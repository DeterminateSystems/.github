These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct.

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, colour, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable; try to be your best self.

## Conduct

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
  - We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md); if you lack clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Discussing offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they're off-topic
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour.
They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the community leaders responsible for moderation by emailing `support@flakehub.com`.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
All community leaders must respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

- If you feel something needs attention, don't hesitate to email the FlakeHub moderation team via `support@flakehub.com`.
- If a community leader bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please **privately take it up with that community leader or a different community leader**.
  - Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
- Community leaders are held to a higher standard than other community members.
  - If a community leader creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces and external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any interaction or public communication with the community for a specified time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any public interaction within the community.

## Scope

This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behaviour occurring outside the scope of community activities, in all community spaces — online and in-person — as well as in all one-on-one communications, including [Discord channels](https://discord.com/invite/a4EcQQ8STr); GitHub repositories under [determinatesystems](https://github.com/determinatesystems), [FlakeHub.com](https://flakehub.com), and comments in social media accounts operated by Determinate Systems.
Exhibitors, speakers, sponsors, staff and all other attendees at events organized by Determinate Systems are subject to these Community Guidelines and Code of Conduct.
